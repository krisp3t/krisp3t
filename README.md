# Kris Petrič (クリス・ペトリッチ) 👋
I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student in University of Ljubljana, excited about gamedev.

My areas of interest include: 
- 🖼️ graphics programming (currently DX11), shaders
- 🎡 engine development (ECS, memory management, parallelism, math / physics)
- 🔉 audio (synthesis, VST plugins)
- 🎮 gameplay (mostly worked with Godot 3/4, learning Unity)

In my spare time I'm learning to draw (pixelart, digital, traditional) 🎨 and produce music (guitar, Ableton) 🎸. I'm also studying Japanese 🎌.
